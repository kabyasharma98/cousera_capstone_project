Toronto hosts a large number of Indians who migrate to Canada in search of better living standards and life opportunity and what better than Indian food to keep the Indians and their taste buds satisfied. So this business idea can be adopted and used for making more and more profit, because Indians love to spend life eating and celebrating. Now, to\nmake more profit we need to find an area which is famous or good but has less number of ice-cream\nparlour so that we can get minimum competition. So, before an investment results of this project\ncan be really helpful."

Firstly, we need to get the list of neighbourhoods in the city of Bangalore. \nFortunately, the list is available in the Wikipedia page and was also udes in previous assignments\n(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M). We import all the modules of python which help us with\nweb scraping using Python requests and pandas packages to extract the list of\nneighbourhoods data. However, this is just a list of names.\n2. We need to get the geographical coordinates in the form of latitude and longitude in\norder to be able to use Foursquare API. To do so, we will use the wonderful\nGeocoder package that will allow us to convert address into geographical\ncoordinates in the form of latitude and longitude.\n3. After gathering the data, we will populate the data into a pandas DataFrame and\nthen visualize the neighbourhoods in a map using Folium package. This allows us to\nperform a sanity check to make sure that the geographical coordinates data returned\nby Geocoder are correctly plotted in the city of Toronto.\n4. Next, we will use Foursquare API to get the top 300 venues that are within a radius\nof 5000 meters. We need to register a Foursquare Developer Account in order to\nobtain the Foursquare ID and Foursquare secret key.\n5. We then make API calls to Foursquare passing in the geographical coordinates of the\nneighbourhoods in a Python loop. Foursquare will return the venue data in JSON\nformat and we will extract the venue name, venue category, venue latitude and\nlongitude.\n6. With the data, we can check how many venues were returned for each\nneighbourhood and examine how many unique categories can be curated from all\nthe returned venues.\n7. Then, we will analyse each neighbourhood by grouping the rows by neighbourhood\nand taking the mean of the frequency of occurrence of each venue category.\n8. By doing so, we are also preparing the data for use in clustering. Since we are\nanalysing the \u201cIndian Restaurant\u201d data, we will filter the \u201cIndian Restaurant\u201d as venue\ncategory for the neighbourhoods.\n9. Lastly, we will perform clustering on the data by using k-means clustering. K-means\nclustering algorithm identifies k number of centroids, and then allocates every data\npoint to the nearest cluster, while keeping the centroids as small as possible.\n10.  It is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms and\nis particularly suited to solve the problem for this project. We will cluster the\nneighbourhoods into 9 clusters based on their frequency of occurrence for \u201cIndian Restaurant\u201d. The results will allow us to identify which neighbourhoods have higher\nconcentration of Indian Restaurant while which neighbourhoods have fewer number\nof Indian Restaurants. Based on the occurrence of Indian Restaurants in different\nneighbourhoods, it will help us to answer the question as to which neighbourhoods\nare most suitable to open Indian Restaurant."
