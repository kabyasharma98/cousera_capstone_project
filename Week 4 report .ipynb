Toronto hosts a large number of Indians who migrate to Canada in search of better living standards and life opportunity and what better than Indian food to keep the Indians and their taste buds satisfied. So this business idea can be adopted and used for making more and more profit, because Indians love to spend life eating and celebrating. Now, to\nmake more profit we need to find an area which is famous or good but has less number of ice-cream\nparlour so that we can get minimum competition. So, before an investment results of this project\ncan be really helpful."

We will use web scraping techniques to extract the data from the Wikipedia page, with the help of Python\nrequests and pandas packages. Then we will get the geographical coordinates of the\nneighbourhoods using Python Geocoder package which will give us the latitude and longitude\ncoordinates of the neighbourhoods.\nAfter that, we will use Foursquare API to get the venue data for those neighbourhoods. Foursquare\nhas one of the largest database of 105+ million places and is used by over 125,000 developers.\nFoursquare API will provide many categories of the venue data, we are particularly interested in the\nIndian restuarant category in order to help us to solve the business problem put forward. This is a\nproject that will make use of many data science skills, from web scraping (Wikipedia), working with\nAPI (Foursquare), data cleaning, data wrangling, to machine learning (K-means clustering) and map\nvisualization (Folium). In the next section, we will present the Methodology section where we will\ndiscuss the steps taken in this project, the data analysis that we did and the machine learning\ntechnique that was used."
